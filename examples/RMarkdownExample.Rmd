Test Plots with RMarkdown and OpenStreetMapR
========================================================

Open StreetMapR is designes to work either interactively with plots or interactively within an RMarkdown document.  Reporting and reproducible research at it's best!

Let's take a look at a dataset.

```{r }
library(OpenStreetMapR)
df = data.frame(lat=runif(100, 38,40), long=-runif(100, 104,106), 
                size=runif(100)*20, color=sample(rainbow(10), 100, replace=T))

head(df)
```

You can plot this in a window easily with

```{r echo=TRUE}
#plot(OSMMap(df)
#plot(OSMMap(df, size='size', color='color'))
```


But you can also include this data as part of your RMarkdown just as easily, just print the OSMap object and make sure to turn on: .

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
(print(OSMMap(df, size='size', color='color')))

```
